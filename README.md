A few things every person should know:

1. Never mix bleach and borax: you will create the noxious gas boric acid and may die a painful death.
2. The pilot bearing on a manual transmission can be removed by compacting grease-soaked rags into the cavity behind it.
3. George Washington was once shot 5 times in a single battle (and he kept fighting!).
4. The fourth verse of Don McLean's "American Pie" refers to the disastrous 1969 Altamont Music Festival.
5. A quick squirt of lemon juice can (somewhat) mitigate the deleterious aspects of overcooked pasta.
